        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Software Engineering and have professional experience as a DevOps Engineer at Mongolia's largest commercial enterprise. My background also includes expertise in Information Security, where I specialize as a Microsoft Security Expert. Based in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, I enjoy playing basketball and am actively seeking opportunities in Software Engineering. I am particularly interested in roles focused on Java or JavaScript development, as well as positions in DevOps and DevSecOps Engineering.
